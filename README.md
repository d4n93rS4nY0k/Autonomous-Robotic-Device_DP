# Autonomous Robotic Device [ *GRADUATION PROJECT* ]

## Description

An **autonomous robotic device** - is a robot that able to perform tasks and make decisions without constant management Man. For the perception of the environment by an autonomous robot - on it sensors, lasers, scanners, microphones, cameras, radars and lidars. These, in combination with the appropriate software, are able to identify and classify objects, their location, ambient temperature, and more, and, in on the information collected, to make appropriate actions.   

The purpose of the graduation project was to develop a model of a robot direction finder with radio signal detection and tracking. Such a project is necessary to test the idea of using a direction finding system in order to In the future, implement a full-scale robot prototype that will directly carry out military tasks.
